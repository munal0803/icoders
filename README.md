# Icoders

In todayâ€™s scenario team work become an important thing/skill to learn in order
to work in corporate world.
Our iCoder website provides user a platform where every user can interact with
order user and find appropriate teammate to work on any project.
In Our website we have provided various filters for user to sort out and filter out
for the desired teammate having same technological interest.
We hope Icoders can be used by developers to connect and help each other.


Icoder bridges the gap of not having a programming partner. Although
currently in the initial stage the project still functions with a page which has all
the projects listed. The feed page updates frequently. Overall, the project helps
to network people in tech domain and with future add on may be live very
soon in the near future.

There is a future scope of this facility that many more features such as ability to
like and share different hackathons and coding competitions. Also search and
chat features are seeming to be very beneficial to the current program. We can
also enhance the current implementation of the recommendation feature.
In a nutshell, we feel that iCoder has a high scalability scope and we can
implement as many features that might be useful to the users.
